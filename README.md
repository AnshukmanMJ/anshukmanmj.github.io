# anshukmanmj.github.io

A simple, fast personal website hosted via **GitHub Pages**, built with **HTML** and **CSS**. This repo powers the site at https://anshukmanmj.github.io. [5][4]

## Features
- Lightweight static pages with semantic HTML and responsive CSS. [5]
- Zero server maintenance using GitHub Pages hosting. [5]
- Easy to extend with additional pages/sections (projects, blog, contact). [6]

## Tech stack
- HTML (structure, content) [5]
- CSS (layout, theming) [5]
- GitHub Pages (static hosting) [5]

## Quick start
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/AnshukmanMJ/anshukmanmj.github.io` [5]
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to preview locally. [5]
3. Edit HTML/CSS files, commit, and push to trigger GitHub Pages build. [5]

## Project structure
- `/index.html` — Landing page markup. [5]
- `/assets/` — Images, icons, and other static assets (create if needed). [5]
- `/styles/` or `/style.css` — Site styles, variables, and responsive rules. [5]

## Customization
- Update meta tags (title, description, social preview) in `<head>` of `index.html`. [6]
- Add sections (About, Projects, Contact) with semantic tags (`<section>`, `<article>`). [6]
- Use a favicon and Open Graph/Twitter tags for better sharing previews. [6]

## Local development tips
- Use a simple HTTP server to test relative paths and assets:
  - Python: `python3 -m http.server 8000` → visit http://localhost:8000 [5]
- Validate HTML/CSS with W3C validators for accessibility and quality. [6]

## Deployment
This repository is configured for GitHub Pages. Push to the default branch and wait for the Pages workflow to publish. Check repository Settings → Pages for the live URL. [5][4]

## Roadmap
- Add Projects section with cards and links. [4]
- Introduce a simple blog using Markdown-to-HTML or a static site generator later. [4]
- Dark mode toggle via CSS variables and prefers-color-scheme. [6]
